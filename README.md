📝 Text Classification using Machine Learning

📌 Overview
This project builds a text classification model to categorize text into predefined classes. It uses machine learning techniques for feature extraction and classification.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 
Pandas (Data Handling)
Scikit-learn (ML Models)
TF-IDF Vectorization

📂 Dataset
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file (text.csv).
Contains text data with labeled categories.

🏗️ Model Workflow
Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and preparing text data
Feature Extraction – TF-IDF applied to convert text into numerical format
Model Training – Used Multinomial Naïve Bayes
Evaluation – Accuracy, Precision, Recall

📉 Results
The model successfully classifies text into relevant categories.
🔥 Future Enhancements
Use Deep Learning models like LSTMs, Transformers
Implement real-time text classification API
